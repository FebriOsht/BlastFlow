📖 Product Summary

BlastFlow is not just another WhatsApp bot. It is the Command Center for your business communication strategy.

In the digital era, customers ignore rigid spam messages. BlastFlow exists to bridge the gap between bulk broadcast efficiency and personal message warmth. Built with a modern interface (Glassmorphism UI) and high-security logic, BlastFlow transforms Excel data into conversations that drive conversions.

"The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing. It feels like a conversation."

🔥 Key Features (Dual-Mode Engine)

BlastFlow is equipped with two sending engines designed for different scenarios:

1. 📢 Broadcast Mode (Bulk Sender)

Designed for quick announcements, flash sales, or new product info.

Smart Tagging: Use the [Name] tag to automatically greet thousands of people by their respective names.

High Throughput: Capable of processing large message queues with high stability.

Visual Queue: Monitor the delivery status of each number in real-time.

2. 💬 Personal Chat Mode (Drafting Room)

A flagship feature for High-Ticket Sales approaches or priority client Follow-ups.

Card-Based View: Customer data is displayed in the form of interactive cards.

Individual Editing: You can edit the message for "John" to be highly specific, while the message for "Jane" remains using the standard template.

Selective Sending: Send only to those whose messages you have approved.

💎 Technology Highlights

🧠 Intelligent Excel Parser

Forget complicated CSV formats. BlastFlow reads Excel files (.xlsx) intelligently.

Auto-Detect: The system automatically recognizes Name and Phone Number columns, regardless of their position.

Number Formatting: Automatically converts local formats (e.g., 08xxx) into international formats (e.g., 628xxx) to ensure valid delivery.

🛡️ Human-Like Behavior & Security

WhatsApp account security is a top priority.

Randomized Delay: The system inserts random time delays between messages (3-7 seconds) to mimic natural human typing behavior.

Auto-Reset 24H: An automatic security system that logs out the session every day at midnight (00:00) to ensure the encryption token remains fresh and secure.

🎨 Modern User Interface

Glassmorphism Design: A clean, futuristic interface that is easy on the eyes.

Secure Login: Login page protected with native WhatsApp Web QR Code integration.

Toast Notifications: Interactive feedback using modern animations (SweetAlert2).
